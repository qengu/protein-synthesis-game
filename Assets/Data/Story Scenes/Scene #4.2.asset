      RNA that is made in a special place inside the nucleus called the nucleolus.

    text: The tRNA initially starts off at the P site, also called initiation. Then,
      another tRNA slides into the A site. A polypeptide bond forms between the amino
      acids, which sticks out at the top of the tRNA.

    text: Then, the entire apparatus shifts over, making the tRNA initially in the
      P site move to the E site, where it leaves and goes on to find another amino
      acid and do its job at another ribosome.
